#What is GraphQL

1. It is a query language for API. GraphQL has two sides - the graphql server where you write your api and expose it to an end point and second is the frontend where user asks for data from server.

2. The syntax is extremely user friendly.

3. GraphQL needs to have a technology like Apollo, modern Relay etc for implementation.

4. Instead of recieving everythinh or nothing by normal request you can ask for selective info

#GraphQL example (Running App build using grapQL, react)

# Important notes

1. Endpoint - even every individual data record, has its own endpoint. The endpoint is what you'll point your HTTP client at to interact with data resources.
